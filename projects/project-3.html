            For this project I designed a landing page for Smart private lease.
            A landing page means that the customer most likely ended up on this
            page via a search engine. It is therefore important that all
            information is on this page, as the customer may not have seen the
            previous pages. However, the design needs to blend in with the rest
            of the website in terms of styling.
          </p>

          <h3>Design challenge</h3>
          <p>
            How do we ensure that the customer receives all information clearly
            and is thereby convinced to lease a car privately at Smart
          </p>

            Things that struck me

            <ul>
              <li>
                The first thing you see is a man looking at you and pointing at
                you. This gives a personal, but also a bit intimidating feeling
              </li>
              <li>
                In addition, it is stated in keywords what you will receive
                approximately.
              </li>
              <li>
                If you scroll down you will see all packages. One is orange
                framed. It says it's the TV action. This option immediately
                stands out.
              </li>
              <li>
                You can choose whether you want to take out a package per month
                or per year. They are the same packages, but those for a year
                are cheaper per month.
              </li>
              <li>
                Per package is shown what you get. All related data is at the
                same height, so it's easy to compare.
              </li>
              <li>
                Furthermore, the page states what they offer. It's a bit
                repetitive, this would annoy me.
              </li>
            </ul>

              <li>

            Things that struck me

            <ul>
              <li>
                The first thing that stood out were photos of people holding a
                takedaily box with a text cloud about what they think of
                takedaily. This immediately gives a personal feeling.

              <li>
                Then it is explained how they work. You can do a test or put
                together something yourself.
              </li>
              <li>
                After additional explanation, they have even more reviews. There
                are no photos here.
              </li>
              <li>
                Do not necessarily have an x ​​number of options. You fill in a
                questionnaire and something is put together based on your
                answers. That gives a feeling of reciprocity, because they make
                a plan especially for you.
