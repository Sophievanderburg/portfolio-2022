                    For this project I designed a landing page for Smart private lease. A landing page means that the customer most likely ended up on this page via a search engine. It is therefore important that all information is on this page, as the customer may not have seen the previous pages. However, the design needs to blend in with the rest of the website in terms of styling.

                <h3>Design challenge</h3>
                <p>How do we ensure that the customer receives all information clearly and is thereby convinced to lease a car privately at Smart</p>
